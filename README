sge_master: snmpd, awk

INSTALL
==============================================
(1) Copy all files in your web accesible filesystem or download the project using GIT:
    git clone git://github.com/HPCKP/PHPQstat.git
(2) Setup the following paths on phpqstat.conf :
    SGE_ROOT=/sge
    RRD_ROOT=/var/www/PHPQstat/rrd
    WEB_ROOT=/var/www/PHPQstat
(3) Setup the following config variables in config.inc.php :
    $qstat_reduce="yes";
    $cache_time="3";
(4) If using qstat_reduce set LOAD_WAIT variable in phpqstat.conf for high load average protection :
    LOAD_WAIT=10.00
(5) Add the following line on the crontab :
    */3 * * * * /var/www/PHPQstat/accounting.sh > /dev/null 2>&1

SETTING UP A REMOTE MASTER CONFIG
----------------------------------------------
(6) Set REMOTE_MASTER in phpqstat.conf to the hostname of sge_master server :
    REMOTE_MASTER=sgemaster.company.com
(7) Configure snmpd on sge_master host to provide uptime and load information via community public :

    com2sec notConfigUser  default       public
    group   notConfigGroup v1           notConfigUser
    view    systemview    included   .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10
    access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  systemview none none

ROADMAP
