SCREENSHOTS
==============================================
Screenshots were taken from a test instance of Son of Grid Engine 8.1.9


Queue Status page with two test queues.

All Jobs on the cluster, both running and in queue, tables are sortable by field, in the screenshot I am using the search feature to filter the running jobs table.

All Jobs on the cluster with multiple parallel environment jobs with the new display scheme that shows all queues grouped with a single job.

Job information page displaying some details about a running job.

Hosts Status with only the one desktop as the single host, so not very impressive looking.

webserver host: apache, php5, rrdtool, awk, snmp-utils  
sge_master host: snmpd, awk  

INSTALL
==============================================
1. Copy all files in your web accesible filesystem or download the project using GIT:  
    git clone https://github.com/LydiaSevelt/PHPQstat
2. Setup the following paths on phpqstat.conf :  
    SGE_ROOT=/opt/sge  
    SGE_CELL=default  
    RRD_ROOT=/var/www/PHPQstat/rrd  
    WEB_ROOT=/var/www/PHPQstat  
3. Edit the line: "source /var/www/PHPQstat/phpqstat.conf" to point to the location of your phpqstat.conf  
   in your web root in the files :  
    accounting.sh  
    qinfo.sh  
4. Setup the following config variables in config.inc.php :  
    $qstat_reduce="yes";  
    $cache_time="3";  
5. If using Univa Grid Engine set the variable in config.inc.php :  
    $UGE="yes";  
6. If using Son of Grid Engine and you do *not* already have a /$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/settings.sh file  
   then copy the sog.8.1.9.settings.sh file to /$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/settings.sh and modify  
   the variables to match your config :  
     export SGE_ROOT="/opt/sge"  
     export SGE_CELL="default"  
     export SGE_CLUSTER_NAME="p6444"  
     export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/sge/lib//libdrmaa.so"  
7. If using qstat_reduce set LOAD_WAIT variable in phpqstat.conf for high load average protection :  
    LOAD_WAIT=10.00  
8. Add the following line to the proper users crontab, making sure you replace /var/www/PHPQstat with the proper path :  
    */3 * * * * /var/www/PHPQstat/accounting.sh > /dev/null 2>&1

  SETTING UP A REMOTE MASTER CONFIG
  ----------------------------------------------
9. Set REMOTE_MASTER in phpqstat.conf to the hostname of sge_master server :  
    REMOTE_MASTER=sgemaster.company.com  
10. Configure snmpd on sge_master host to provide uptime and load information via community public :  
    ```
    com2sec notConfigUser  default       public  
    group   notConfigGroup v1           notConfigUser  
    view    systemview    included   .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10  
    access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  systemview none none  
    ```
    
  OPTIONAL
  ----------------------------------------------
11. Replace PHPQstat/img/logo.png with the logo of your company/school to brand the page
